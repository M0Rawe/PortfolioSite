  <p>As part of a university module, Engineering Entrepreneurship, my cohort was set the task of working in teams to create an innovate product, simulating the startup experience. This involved a full suite of responsibilities including the technical product, the marketing and business strategies, in addition to a thorough financial five year plan. After forming a five person group with close classmates, discussions began regarding the assignment of roles, and I put myself forward for CEO, with experience of team management in a retail setting I felt well poised for the role.</p>
  <p>Over 8 weeks of discussion and market research, we settled on a gardening assistant as our product, involving a mobile application, sensor system, and a base station.</p>
  <p>As CEO, I was not directly responsible for technical development, instead having a member assigned each to the hardware and software development. However, I focused on helping where I could, such as mobile app development with Java and networking development with MQTT. </p>
  <p>With additional experience in a professional engineering role, I understood the dynamics of working in a team, and proposed the use of Jira and a weekly standup on Monday mornings in addition to meeting with the University department on Wednesdays. This ensured that progress was consistent and all team members were able to help others if needed.</p>
  <p>After months of development, our final technical MVP was finished. Our idea revolved around the use of data to assist novice gardeners in the hobby, and thus the smart sensor was at the core of our idea. The final sensor involved a small battery powered unit to be placed in the soil, measuring temperature, moisture, humidity and illumination. These metrics were then transmitted to our base station over a Thread mesh network as  CoAP message.</p>

  </div>
  <p>This message is received by the base station, which is designed to take the CoAP messages, storing them in a database, alongside an overall score out of 100 to be presented to the user. Our mobile application, initially developed on Android provides an interface for the user, in addition to other features such as an intelligent calendar to provide advice regarding when to water the plant. </p>

  <p>Our unique selling point revolved around the gamification of the system, championed by our mascot, Mulchie. Mulchie’s mood reflects the state of the user’s garden, and can be customised by unlocking outfits for maintaining their garden, in addition to paid outfits as an additional revenue stream.</p>
  <p>Overall the module was a success, scoring 74% across a range of assessments involving a business pitch, technical report and business reports. I will be happy to provide these reports to those that are interested, see the contact section of the site.</p>
